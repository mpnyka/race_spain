		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This is the publicly available version of the ILSEG data (ILSEG is the Spanish acronym for Investigación Longitudinal de la Segunda Generación, Longitudinal Study of the Second Generation).  Questions address the current situation and plans for the future of young Spaniards who are children of immigrants to Spain, who were living in Madrid and Barcelona and attending secondary school in 2007-2008.
<br></br>
The longitudinal study of the second Generation (ISLEG in its Spanish initials) represents the first attempt to conduct a large-scale study of the adaptation of children of immigrants to Spanish society over time. To that end, a large and statistically representative sample of children born to foreign parents in Spain or those brought at an early age to the country was identified and interviewed in metropolitan Madrid and Barcelona. In total, almost 7,000 children of immigrants attending basic secondary school in close to 200 educational centers in both cities took part in the study.
<br></br>
Topics include basic demographics, national origins, Spanish language acquisition, foreign language knowledge and retention, parents' education and employment, respondents' education and aspirations, religion, household arrangements, life experiences, and attitudes about Spanish society.
<br></br>
Demographic variables include age, sex, birth country, language proficiency (Spanish and Catalan), language spoken in the home, number of siblings, mother's and father's birth country, religion, national identity, parent's sex, parent's marital status, parent's birth year, and the year the parent arrived in Spain.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Scope of Project:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> 2007</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> 2007 -- 2008</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> Not all the questionnaire items are included in this public release submission. Many of the open-ended items contain too little information to be included. Others presented translation and coding challenges that could not be addressed at this point in time, particularly because of languages (e.g. Catalan, Galician), and non-standard language usages and terminology. We will provide more variables in future releases and more of the open-ended detail for a version in the
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/cmd/data/ilseg-2/"> ILSEG non-curated site.</a>, Variables beginning with the letter p correspond to questions asked of parents., This study as longitudinal. However, responses are not classified by collection date.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The aim of this study is to know more about the youth of foreign origin living today in Spain. This study is important because until now very little is known about the situation and future prospects of these young people.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> This release includes the data from wave one and the parental follow-up survey only.The original survey was conducted in 2007-08; four years later, the same sample was traced and re-interviewed either at school, via telephone, or through contact in the social media (Facebook and Tuenti). Through these means, the research team was able to identify and re-interview 73 percent of the original sample for which retrieval information was available. An additional replacement sample of over 1,500 second generation youths of the same average age as the original respondents was interviewed in the same schools in which the original study took place. Finally, and for comparative purposes, a sample of native-parentage Spanish youths was interviewed at the same time.
<br></br>
To supplement the information from immigrant children, the study also conducted a person-to-person survey of 25 percent of their parents.   They were interviewed in Spanish or in their native language.  The parental survey is representative of the earlier studies sample, including near identical proportions of all foreign nationalities present in the latter.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Enrolled students who are children of immigrants in randomly sampled schools in the greater Madrid and Barcelona regions.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Longitudinal</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Children of immigrants in Spain</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Some school-level data is included, Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> face-to-face interview, on-site questionnaire</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> Approximately 100%, with the cooperation of school officials</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> Rosenburg Self-esteem index</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> Data are self-weighted.  Students were selected on the basis of proportional representation of their respective national origins within the respective urban regions.</span></p>
